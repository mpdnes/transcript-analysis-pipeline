  Outline and Overview  - 

  Problem Statement to prove that this is a real problem:
  A.  Captioning is not speech to text -- it is translating.
      It is like converting script to printed words.
      It is analogous to converting speech to ASL.
      OR English to French.

      AND

  B.  Speech to Text does not filter out words correctly.

  C.  "Damn autocorrect" -- machine methods for fixing spelling error and grammer errors actually inject mistakes.
      Many 

  Complexity of the problem:
     - Ethical Issues: 
     - Ethics issues: using the voice of professors and students without explicit consent.
     - This is why we focused on Kinsman's lecture.
       ( Ignore other ethicals issue. )

C4 - captioning software.

Future Work  -- later phases
- Problem : deaf students need to watch lecturer and the captions simultaneously.

- QUESTION: What if we taught a hearing lecture using only captions?
  This has been done.
  Does not need to be an entire course, could be just one class.
  This IS A GREAT IDEA -- EVEN 10 MINUTES OF THE HEARING STUDENTS 
  NEEDING TO WATCH THE CAPTIONS WOULD HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THE 
  WHAT THE DHH students are doing.

  ==> USE TO PROMOTE AN INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENT, and PROMOTE COLLABORATION.

  ==> THIS EXTRAPOLATES TO PEOPLE WHO ARE "OTHER THINKERS" and COLORBLIND.
      CREATE A LECTURE WITH THE RED/GREEN GOING AWAY for "Typical" visioned people. 

  ==> What about deaf / low vision?
